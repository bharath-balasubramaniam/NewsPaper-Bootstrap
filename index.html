                <p class='text-justify content'>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) lab Defence Materials and Stores Research and Development Establishment
                (DMSRDE), Kanpur has developed light weight Bullet Proof Jacket (BPJ) weighing 9.0 kilo grammes, meeting the qualitative requirements
                 of Indian Army.
                <br>
                <p class = 'text-justify content'>The Front Hard Armour Panel (FHAP) jacket was tested at Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL), Chandigarh and met relevant BIS standards.
                The importance of this vital development lies in the fact that each gram of BPJ weight reduction is crucial in enhancing soldier comfort while ensuring
                the survivability. This technology reduces the weight of the medium sized BPJ from 10.4 to 9.0 kilo grammes. Very specific materials and processing
                technologies have been developed in the laboratories for the purpose. Raksha Mantri Rajnath Singh congratulated the DRDO scientists and Industry for
                developing the light weight BPJ to make the soldiers more comfortable. Secretary Department of Defence R&D and Chairman Defence Research & Development Organisation 
                (DRDO) Dr G Satheesh Reddy congratulated the DMSRDE team for the development.</p>
